2. Rock Classification using ML Ensembles

Focus: Multiclass Classification, Model Comparison, Ensemble Learning

Processed rock classification dataset with ~22 features.

Trained and evaluated: Softmax Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest Classifier

Performed hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV, Implemented Voting Classifier (Hard & Soft) for ensemble performance.

Evaluated models with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores on train/val/test splits.



3. Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering

Focus: PCA, t-SNE, LLE, MDS, Clustering (K-Means & GMM)

Unzipped and visualized high-dimensional rock image data.

Applied dimensionality reduction: PCA, t-SNE, MDS, Locally Linear Embedding

Identified optimal number of clusters using: Elbow Method for K-Means, BIC Scores for GMM

Visualized cluster boundaries and reconstructed principal component embeddings.



4. Image Classification – Trees, Shirts, and Cars

Focus: Deep Learning, Image Classification

Dataset: Custom images of shirts, trees, and cars.

Built a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras: Used Sequential model with dense, dropout, and batch normalization layers.
Trained with categorical cross-entropy loss and early stopping.

Evaluated on validation accuracy and training loss curves.
